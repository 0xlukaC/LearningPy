      Answer in 3-4 bullet points:
        ◦ Why is it important to have both an SRS and an SDD in the software development lifecycle?

    Research the following links (supplementing with your own research where you feel it is necessary) and answer the following questions:

            ▪ What system was investigated any why?
            ▪ Which documents (SRS and/or SDD) may have been reviewed by investigators and which parts of these would have interested them?


Importance of SRS and SDD:

The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines what the system should do, bringing clarity and alignment between stakeholders.
The Software Design Document (SDD) outlines how the system will achieve the requirements, essentially a blueprint.
Together, they reduce miscommunication, improve planning and allocated work throughout the development lifecycle.




Concerning the Healthcare.gov, the U.S. federal health insurance marketplace website. Its launch in 2013 was a major failure and experienced crashes, login errors, and performance issues. It failed under real-world load, leaving users unable to access healthcare services.

likley both
SRS to check if clear, realistic, and testable requirements for system performance, user capacity, security, and availability were properly documented.
SDD to evaluate whether the system’s architecture was planned to meet those requirements.
