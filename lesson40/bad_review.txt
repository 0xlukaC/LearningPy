    • Write a text file, bad_review.txt, study the following code fragment and answer the following:

def check(word):
    a = ""
    for i in range(len(word)-1,-1,-1):
        a = a + word[i]
    if a==word:
        return True
    else:
        return False

      (Allow 3–4 bullet points for each prompt)
        ◦ Identify the intention for this function and suggest at least two ways this code could be improved for clarity, style, or performance
        ◦ Suggest a more "Pythonic" way to reverse the string and explain how it improves readability
        ◦ How could this function be adapted or extended (elegantly) if it needed to ignore spaces and capitalisation?

        reverses a string and checks if it is a palindrome

        just use a slice like word[::-1] to reverse the string, which is more readable and concise.
        to ignore spaces and capitalization, you could use word.replace(" ", "").lower() before checking if it is a palindrome.
