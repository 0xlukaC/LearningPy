Three main parts of a class in UML class diagrams:

class Name/top section: shows the name of the class.

middle section/attributes: lists the data members/variables of the class, with types and visibility.

Operations (Methods): lists the functions the class can perform, with parameters, return types, and visibility.

Two benefits of designing classes using UML before coding:

Clear structure and planning:
Visualizes class relationships, responsibilities, and interactions before implementation.

Better team communication:
Acts as a shared, understandable blueprint for developers, reducing misunderstandings.
