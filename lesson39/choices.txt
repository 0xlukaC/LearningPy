      Answer in 6–7 bullet points:
        ◦ Reflect on a time (real or imagined) when you had to choose between two tools or approaches while programming. Consider adding to your response:
            ▪ What tools were involved and what made the decision difficult
            ▪ What trade-offs did you consider (e.g., learning curve, documentation)
            ▪ How did your values or goals influence the final choice
        ◦ Imagine you are mentoring a new developer who must choose between Flask and Django for their first web project. Consider adding to your response:
            ▪ What factors would you encourage them to consider and why
            ▪ What advice would you give based on your own experiences
            ▪ How would you help them decide for themselves, rather than choosing for themc

    One time I had to decide on how I would deploy a webserver for a school project (In c). I tested a webserver with apache. however,
     that was cumbersome and was difficult to set up with c and a restricted linux enviroment. I then chose to write my own webserver which took a lot more time and wasnt really beneficial in anyway
     I valued having a good project to be showed off. In retrospect I should have just used apache and focused on the project itself rather than the webserver.


     Choose flask because its more commonly used, easier to learn and fine for small projects. Django is more complex and has a steeper learning curve, which might be overwhelming for a new developer.
