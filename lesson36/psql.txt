. Create a new PostgreSQL database called my_cars
        2. Connect to the database using psql
        3. Create a table called cars with fields:
            ▪ id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY)
            ▪ model (TEXT)
            ▪ factory (TEXT)
        4. Insert 5 cars into the table using INSERT INTO
            ▪ e.g., Shelby Cobra (model) made by Shelby (factory)
            ▪ e.g., Lotus Elise (model) made by Lotus (factory)
            ▪ e.g., Skyline GTR (model) made by Nissan (factory)
            ▪ e.g., M3 E30 (model) made by BMW (factory)
        5. Run a SELECT query to list all of your cars
        6. Run an UPDATE to change one of the models to another by the same factory
        7. Run DELETE to remove one of your cars

createdb my_cars
psql my_cars

CREATE TABLE cars (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    model TEXT,
    factory TEXT
);

INSERT INTO cars (model, factory) VALUES
('Shelby Cobra', 'Shelby'),
('Lotus Elise', 'Lotus'),
('Skyline GTR', 'Nissan'),
('M3 E30', 'BMW'),
('X5 M', 'BMW');

SELECT * FROM cars

UPDATE cars SET model = 'M5 CS' WHERE model = 'X5 M';

DELETE FROM cars WHERE model = 'Skyline GTR';
