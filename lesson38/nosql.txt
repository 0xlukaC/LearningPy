What is the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
◦ Identify and describe some of the advantages of using MongoDB for flexible data models?

The dynamic nature of MongoDB schema is useful because most of the data that is being generated by internet applications and IoT devices are non-structured which cannot be saved in a traditional SQL database.
also its helpful if you want to store data that you dont know how it will be used later

Answer in 2–3 bullet points:
◦ Describe a real-world use case where MongoDB might be more suitable than a traditional relational database (like PostgreSQL)


Flexible Schema for Product Catalogs: E-commerce platforms constantly introduce new products, product categories, and variations. These items often have widely diverse attributes (e.g., a t-shirt has size and color, a laptop has RAM and processor speed, a book has author and ISBN). In MongoDB, a document database, each product can be represented by a JSON-like document with its own unique set of fields. This "schemaless" or flexible schema approach is incredibly agile. In contrast, a relational database would require altering the table schema with ALTER TABLE statements for every new attribute
