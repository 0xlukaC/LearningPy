• Write in-order the mongosh commands to do the following in a text file, mongo.txt:
1. Create a new database called my_motorcycles
2. Create a collection named garage
3. Insert three documents with fields:
    ▪ model
    ▪ factory
    ▪ with_mechanics (boolean)
4. Insert 3 documents into the collection
    ▪ e.g., Suzuki GSXR (model) made by Suzuki (factory)
    ▪ e.g., Ducati 999 (model) made by Ducati (factory)
5. Run a find() query to list all motorcycles which are not with the mechanics
6. Change the with_mechanics field on one of your documents
7. Delete one motorcycle from the collection


use my_motorcycles

db.createCollection(garage, {})

db.collection.insertMany([
  { model: "Suzuki GSXR", factory: "Suzuki", with_mechanics: false },
  { model: "Ducati 999", factory: "Ducati", with_mechanics: true },
  { model: "Kawasaki Ninja", factory: "Kawasaki", with_mechanics: false }
])

db.garage.find({ with_mechanics: false })

db.garage.updateOne(
    { model: "Ducati 999" },
    { $set: { with_mechanics: false } } // $set operator to change the field
)

db.garage.deleteOne({ model: "Kawasaki Ninja" })
